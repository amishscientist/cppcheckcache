# cppcheckcache
A poor attemped to make a chaching mechanism for cppcheck
I started working on this on a weekend a couple of years a go.  I don't remember the state of the code or even if it is working.  I know it had issues at the time.  I'm sure a cppcheck internal approuch would probably be a lot more efficent, but I was hopeing to always go back and rewrite a python version that was generic.  There are a few source checking tools that could probably uses this to help speed them up for local devlopers or even for big CI pipelines.
